## Chapter 3
- `Nat.agda`:
  - I defined the `fib` function in terms of the induction principle and linear recursion (tail recursion). How can we express `fib` with the induction principle but in its non-linear form
  - Prove that all recursive functions are equivalent to their tail recursive counterparts
  - Finish exercise 3.6. Define division by two in terms of the induction principle
